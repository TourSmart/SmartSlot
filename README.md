üß† Project Title:

AI-Based Timetable Generation System aligned with NEP 2020 for Multidisciplinary Education Structures

üìò Project Description:

The AI-Based Timetable Generation System is an intelligent web-based platform designed to automate and optimize the process of creating academic timetables in educational institutions. Aligned with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, the system supports multidisciplinary courses, flexible learning structures, and real-time scheduling for students, faculty, and administrators.

Leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the system analyzes input data such as faculty availability, course structures, classroom resources, and student enrollments to generate conflict-free, optimized timetables. It dynamically adapts to future curriculum changes, faculty additions, and NEP-based reforms, reducing the manual workload and scheduling errors.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features:

AI/ML-Assisted Timetable Generation
Automatically generates semester-wise timetables for multiple programs (B.Ed., M.Ed., FYUP, ITEP).

Conflict-Free Scheduling
Prevents overlaps across faculty, classrooms, and departments using intelligent slot allocation algorithms.

Dynamic and Scalable
Easily accommodates new courses, updated NEP guidelines, and infrastructure changes.

Integrated Data Management
Accepts structured inputs from academic, faculty, and student databases for accurate timetable creation.

Exportable and Shareable
Allows users to export timetables in PDF and Excel formats for distribution and record-keeping.

Real-Time Updates
Enables administrators to make instant modifications and publish updated timetables seamlessly.

Compatibility with Academic Management Systems
Can be integrated with existing LMS or ERP platforms to ensure smooth institutional workflow.

üß© Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB (for storing user, course, and timetable data)

AI/ML Layer: Python or TensorFlow API integration for conflict detection and optimization

Authentication: NextAuth (for secure access and role-based permissions)
